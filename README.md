This project implements linear regression using Scikit-learn to predict diabetes progression. It is divided into four key tasks:

Task 1: Predict the target variable Y using a single feature to identify the most predictive one.

Task 2: Use a pair of features to improve prediction accuracy.

Task 3: Use all 10 features to build a comprehensive linear regression model.

Task 4: Evaluate training and validation errors using different training sizes: 20, 50, 100, and 200.
